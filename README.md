- These assignments were part of **COMP 250** - Intro to Computer Science Course at **McGill University**.
- Final Grade: **A**

---

### Assignment 1: **Online Marketplace Simulation**  
Covered **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts like abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation by implementing a class hierarchy for products, baskets, and customers. Focused on array manipulation, method overriding, and financial calculations like taxes and subtotals.  

---

### Assignment 2: **Solitaire Encryption Algorithm**  
Explored **cryptography** through the implementation of a stream cipher using a circular doubly linked list to simulate a deck of cards. Focused on algorithm design, recursion, and pseudorandom generation for encoding and decoding messages.  

---

### Assignment 3: **Decision Tree Classifier**  
Introduced **machine learning basics** with decision trees, emphasizing entropy-based data splitting and classification. Focused on recursive tree construction, evaluation of splits, and prevention of overfitting with early stopping conditions.  

---

### Final Project: **Chess Sudoku Solver**  
Covered **recursive backtracking algorithms** to solve classic and Chess Sudoku puzzles with additional chess-inspired constraints. Highlighted optimization techniques for constraint-satisfaction problems and exploration of multiple solutions.
