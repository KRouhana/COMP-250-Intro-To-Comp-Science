### **Summary of the Problem to Solve**
The task involves implementing a **decision tree classifier** to solve a binary classification problem. 

#### Key Elements:
1. **Classification Problem:**
   - Classify data points with attributes `x` (e.g., spatial coordinates) into binary labels (`0` or `1`).

2. **Decision Tree Construction:**
   - Build a decision tree recursively using a dataset.
   - Nodes represent splits based on attributes and thresholds.
   - Use entropy to evaluate the quality of splits, choosing those with the lowest average entropy.

3. **Classification and Testing:**
   - Use the tree to classify new, unlabeled data points by traversing from the root to a leaf node.
   - Implement methods to calculate entropy, find the best splits, and classify data.

4. **Overfitting Prevention:**
   - Apply early stopping when the number of data points in a subset falls below a predefined threshold (`minSizeDatalist`).
