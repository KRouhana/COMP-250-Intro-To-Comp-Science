### **Summary of the Problem to Solve**
The task involves implementing a **Solitaire encryption algorithm** using a **deck of cards** represented as a circular doubly linked list. 

#### Key Components:
1. **Deck of Cards:**
   - Cards include suits, ranks, and two jokers.
   - The deck supports operations such as shuffling, moving cards, and generating keystream values.
   
2. **Encryption Algorithm:**
   - Implements a stream cipher where the deck's initial configuration acts as the key.
   - Encrypts and decrypts messages by shifting characters using a pseudorandom keystream generated by the deck.

3. **Core Operations:**
   - Joker manipulation (e.g., moving jokers).
   - Triple cut: Rearranges sections of the deck.
   - Count cut: Rearranges based on the value of the bottom card.
   - Keystream generation: Produces pseudorandom values for encoding/decoding.
