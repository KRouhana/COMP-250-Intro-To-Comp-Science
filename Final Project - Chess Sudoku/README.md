### **Learning Objectives**
- **Recursive Algorithms:** Learn and implement recursive algorithms, specifically focusing on backtracking for problem-solving.
- **Backtracking:** Understand the concept of depth-first search on trees to incrementally build solutions and backtrack when constraints are violated.
- **Sudoku and Variants:** Gain experience solving classic Sudoku puzzles and Chess Sudoku variants, which add additional constraints inspired by chess moves.
- **Problem Optimization:** Develop strategies to efficiently solve constraint-satisfaction problems, balancing correctness with speed.

### **Computer Science Concepts Covered**
- **Algorithms:**
  - Backtracking for solving constraint-satisfaction problems.
  - Depth-first search applied to a decision tree representation of solutions.
- **Data Structures:**
  - Tree structures for exploring potential Sudoku solutions.
  - Use of grids and 2D arrays for representing puzzles.
- **Constraint Satisfaction:**
  - Implementing rules to ensure no conflicts in rows, columns, sub-grids, and Chess Sudoku constraints (Knight, King, and Queen moves).
- **Optimization and Performance:**
  - Efficiently finding solutions for Sudoku puzzles of varying complexity.
  - Extending the solution to find all possible solutions for a given puzzle.

### **Summary of the Problem to Solve**
The task is to implement a **Sudoku solver** capable of solving both classic Sudoku puzzles and Chess Sudoku variants. 

#### Key Features:
1. **Classic Sudoku:**
   - Solve 9x9 grids ensuring no digit repeats in rows, columns, or 3x3 sub-grids.

2. **Chess Sudoku Variants:**
   - Incorporate additional constraints based on chess rules:
     - **Knight Rule:** Digits must not appear a knight’s move away from themselves.
     - **King Rule:** Digits must not appear a king’s move away from themselves.
     - **Queen Rule:** The largest digit acts as a queen and must not share a row, column, sub-grid, or diagonal with another queen.

3. **Backtracking Algorithm:**
   - Recursively fill the grid, backtracking when constraints are violated.
   - Explore all possible solutions to ensure correctness.

4. **Additional Features:**
   - Support for finding all possible solutions to a given puzzle.
   - Solve square puzzles of sizes up to 5x5, assuming a solution exists.
